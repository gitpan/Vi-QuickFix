NAME
    Vi::QuickFix - Support for vim's QuickFix mode

SYNOPSIS
      use Vi::QuickFix;

      use Vi::QuickFix '/my/errorfile';

      use Vi::QuickFix 'silent';

      use Vi::QuickFix silent => '/my/errorfile';

DESCRIPTION
    When "Vi::QuickFix" is active, Perl logs errors and warnings to an
    *error file* named, by default, "errors.err". This file is picked up
    when vim is called in QuickFix mode as "vim -q". Vim starts editing the
    perl source where the first error occured, at the error location.
    QuickFix allows you to jump from one error to another, switching files
    as necessary. Type ":help quickfix" in vim for a description.

    To activate QuickFix support, add

        use Vi::QuickFix;

    or, specifying an error file

        use Vi::QuickFix '/my/errorfile';

    early in the main program, before other "use" statements.

    To leave the program file unaltered, Vi::QuickFix can be invoked from
    the command line as

        perl -MVi::QuickFix program
    or
        perl -MVi::QuickFix=/my/errorfile program

    "Vi::QuickFix" is meant to be used as a development tool, not to remain
    in a distributed product. When the program ends, a warning is issued
    that "Vi::QuickFix" is active. This has the side effect that there is
    always an entry in the error file which points to the file where
    "Vi::QuickFix" was invoked, normally the main program. "vi -q" will edit
    this file when other error entries don't point it elsewhere. Use the
    "silent" option with "Vi::QuickFix" to suppress this warning.

    It is a fatal error when the error file cannot be opened. If the error
    file is empty (can only happen with "silent"), it is removed at the end
    of the run.

USAGE
    The module file .../Vi/QuickFix.pm can also be called as an executable.
    In that mode, it behaves (roughly) like the "cat" command, but also
    moitors the stream and logs Perl warnings and error messages to the
    error file. The error file can be set through the switches "-f" or "-q".
    No warning about QuickFix activity is issued in this mode.

    Called with -v, it prints the version and exits.

BUGS
    "no Vi::QuickFix" has no effect
